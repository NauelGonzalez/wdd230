        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>

        <h3>Economic DevelopmentTitan's </h3>
        <p> The IMC Chamber of Commerce plays a vital role in promoting economic development on the planet.
            As the colony increases its size and gets more industrialized, businesses and entrepeneurs would see
            opportunities to establish themselves.
            The chamber could provide information and resources for prospective businesses, such as regulatory
            guidelines, market research, investment opportunities and protection against space piracy.
        </p>

        <h3>Trade and Collaboration </h3>
        <p> Mars would likely rely on trade with Earth and other space colonies for essential resources, technology, and
            goods that cannot be produced locally.
            The IMC Chamber of Commerce could serve as a hub for trade negotiations, collaboration agreements, and
            networking between Martian businesses and their counterparts on Earth or other celestial bodies.
        </p>

        <p><b>IMC Resources Hub:</b> With an increasing number of people and organizations interested in

            information on topics such as Martian real estate, legal considerations,
